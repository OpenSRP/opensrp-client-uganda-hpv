# Uganda HPV Android Client

**About**

*Human Papillomavirus (HPV)* is a sexually-transmitted infection that is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women. HPV can also cause other types of cancers in both men and women. The HPV vaccine protects people from getting infected, and thus, from getting cervical cancer, which is a leading cause of death for women in many countries.

There are two different types of HPV vaccine, and they have different schedules, but they can both be given to adolescent girls and boys to protect them against the major strains of HPV.

The OpenSRP HPV module allows health workers to register adolescent girls and record the two doses of the HPV vaccine, which are due 6 months apart. The module is not catered for boys at this stage, because in many countries, the national immunization program covers vaccination for girls only.

**Features**
- Offline-capable adolescent girl registration form, capturing the girl's photo (with her consent), automated ID generation, name, DOB, school name, class in school, caretaker name and phone number, and VHT (i.e. community health worker) name and phone number
- QR code support for the automated ID for easy lookup
- Search function (name or ID)
- Automated schedules and reminders for both HPV vaccine doses
- Service location dropdown (i.e. location of each event recorded in the app)
- Digital vaccine record for HPV
- Ability to call the caretaker or VHT directly from the app
- Remove from register function (i.e. archive the girl's record)
